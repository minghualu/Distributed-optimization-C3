There are 4 different cases, Q-learning for 1 agent and 2 agents. Deep Q-learning for 1 agent and 2 agents. Each case is separated into a environment class, an agent class and a main class where the algorithm is performed.

QL2agents_plotreward plots the reward for each episode at the end. QL2agents_graphics gives a graphical representation of how the agents move in the final episode.
